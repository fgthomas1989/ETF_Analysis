# ETF_Analysis


![Columbia Engineering.](images/Columbia.jpeg)

___
This week, I will look into passive investing by analyzing exchange-traded funds (ETF).

I will do so by building a financial database and web application by using SQL, Python, and the Voilà library to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF.

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with various Libraries and IDE:

* [Jupyterlab](http://justinbois.github.io/bootcamp/2020_fsri/lessons/l01_welcome.html#Jupyter) - An interactive development environment

* [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/) - SQL is a language that was designed to help manage and analyze data that’s in databases.

* [Voila](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - A Python library that allows one to convert a Jupyter Notebook into an interactive dashboard that allows you to share your work with others.

* [PyViz](https://pyviz.org/overviews/index.html) - a is a Python visualization package that provides a single platform for accessing multiple visualization libraries, including hvPlot and GeoViews.

* [hvPlot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/user_guide/Plotting.html) -  a high-level plotting API built on HoloViews that provides a general and consistent API for plotting data in various formats.
